  abstract = {Flood crises are the consequence of climate change and global warming, which lead to an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall. Floods are, and remain, natural disasters that result in huge loss of lives and material damage. Flood risks threaten all countries of the globe in general. The Far-North region of Cameroon has suffered of flood crises on several occasions, resulting in significant loss of human lives, infrastructural and socio-economic damage, with the destruction of homes, crops and grazing areas, and the halting of economic activities. The models used for flood forecasting in this region are generally physical-based, and produce unsatisfactory results. The use of artificial intelligence based methods for flood forecasting in order to limit its consequences is a way to be explored in the Far-North region of Cameroon. The aims of the present research work is to design and compare the performance of Machine Learning and Deep Learning based models such as one dimensional Convolutional Neural Network, Long and Short Term Memory and Multi Layer Perceptron for short-term and long-term flood forecasting in the Far-North region of Cameroon. The models designed take as input the temperature and rainfall time series recorded in this region. Performance criteria used for evaluating models are Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency, Percent Bias, Coefficient of Determination and Root Mean Squared Error. As the results of the design and performance comparison of the models, the best model for short-term flood forecasting is the LSTM model , and the best model for long-term flood forecasting is still the LSTM model. The best models obtained from the comparisons have satisfactory performance and good generalization capabilities, as reflected by the performance criteria. The results of our research work can be used for implementation of floods warning systems and for definition of an effective and efficient flood risk management policies in order to make the Far-North region of Cameroon more resilient to flood crises.},

  abstract = {The imperative for a reliable and accurate flood forecasting procedure stems from the hazardous nature of the disaster. In response, researchers are increasingly turning to innovative approaches, particularly machine learning models, which offer enhanced accuracy compared to traditional methods. However, a notable gap exists in the literature concerning studies focused on the South Asian tropical region, which possesses distinct climate characteristics. This study investigates the applicability and behavior of long short-term memory (LSTM) and transformer models in flood simulation considering the Mahaweli catchment in Sri Lanka, which is mostly affected by the Northeast Monsoon. The importance of different input variables in the prediction was also a key focus of this study. Input features for the models included observed rainfall data collected from three nearby rain gauges, as well as historical discharge data from the target river gauge. Results showed that the use of past water level data denotes a higher impact on the output compared to the other input features such as rainfall, for both architectures. All models denoted satisfactory performances in simulating daily water levels, with Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values greater than 0.77 while the transformer encoder model showed a superior performance compared to encoder–decoder models.},

  abstract = {A reliable and accurate ood forecasting procedure is a critical need due to the hazardous nature of the disaster. Researchers are increasingly favoring innovative approaches with enhanced accuracy, such as machine learning models, over traditional methods for this task. However, lack of such studies regarding South Asian tropical region, which has its own climate characteristics, was unidenti ed as a major issue. This research delves into the viability of employing ANN, LSTM, BLSTM, ConvLSTM2D and Transformer models for multi-day ahead ood simulation. One-day, two-days and three-days were selected as lead times for the task considering the lower reaches of the Mahaweli catchment in Sri Lanka, which is mostly affected by the Northeast Monsoon. The prediction capability of extreme stream ows was also of interest. Observed rainfall data from three nearby rain gauges, along with historical discharges of the target river gauge, serve as input features for the models. The ANN model showed the worst performance, having the mean NSE of 0.67. An improved performance was observed from the Transformer compared to the LSTM based models, especially in multiple day ahead forecasting scenarios. For all the models, the forecasting capability of extreme water levels drops down drastically when the prediction lead time is increased.},

  abstract = {Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, which are highly complex to model. The research on the advancement of flood prediction models contributed to risk reduction, policy suggestion, minimization of the loss of human life, and reduction of the property damage associated with floods. To mimic the complex mathematical expressions of physical processes of floods, during the past two decades, machine learning (ML) methods contributed highly in the advancement of prediction systems providing better performance and cost-effective solutions. Due to the vast benefits and potential of ML, its popularity dramatically increased among hydrologists. Researchers through introducing novel ML methods and hybridizing of the existing ones aim at discovering more accurate and efficient prediction models. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the state of the art of ML models in flood prediction and to give insight into the most suitable models. In this paper, the literature where ML models were benchmarked through a qualitative analysis of robustness, accuracy, effectiveness, and speed are particularly investigated to provide an extensive overview on the various ML algorithms used in the field. The performance comparison of ML models presents an in-depth understanding of the different techniques within the framework of a comprehensive evaluation and discussion. As a result, this paper introduces the most promising prediction methods for both long-term and short-term floods. Furthermore, the major trends in improving the quality of the flood prediction models are investigated. Among them, hybridization, data decomposition, algorithm ensemble, and model optimization are reported as the most effective strategies for the improvement of ML methods. This survey can be used as a guideline for hydrologists as well as climate scientists in choosing the proper ML method according to the prediction task.},

  abstract = {Floods can be very destructive causing heavy damage to life, property, and livelihoods. Global climate change and the consequent sea-level rise have increased the occurrence of extreme weather events, resulting in elevated and frequent food risk. Therefore, accurate and timely food forecasting in coastal river systems is critical to facilitate good food management. However, the computational tools currently used are either slow or inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a Flood prediction tool using Graph Transformer Network (FloodGTN) for river systems. More specifcally, FloodGTN learns the spatio-temporal dependencies of water levels at different monitoring stations using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and an LSTM. It is currently implemented to consider external covariates such as rainfall, tide, and the settings of hydraulic structures (e.g., outfows of dams, gates, pumps, etc.) along the river. We use a Transformer to learn the attention given to external covariates in computing water levels. We apply the FloodGTN tool to data from the South Florida Water Management District, which manages a coastal area that is prone to frequent storms and hurricanes. Experimental results show that FloodGTN outperforms the physics-based model (HEC-RAS) by achieving higher accuracy with 50\% improvement while speeding up run times by at least 500x.},

  abstract = {Flooding is one of the most destructive and costly natural disasters, and climate changes would further increase risks globally. This work presents a novel multimodal machine learning approach for multi-year global flood risk prediction, combining geographical information and historical natural disaster dataset. Our multimodal framework employs state-of-the-art processing techniques to extract embeddings from each data modality, including text-based geographical data and tabular-based time-series data. Experiments demonstrate that a multimodal approach, that is combining text and statistical data, outperforms a single-modality approach. Our most advanced architecture, employing embeddings extracted using transfer learning upon DistilBert model, achieves 75\textbackslash\%-77\textbackslash\% ROCAUC score in predicting the next 1-5 year flooding event in historically flooded locations. This work demonstrates the potentials of using machine learning for long-term planning in natural disaster management.},
