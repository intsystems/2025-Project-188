  abstract = {The study presents a new hybrid method for the simulation of flood events in small catchments. It combines a physically-based two-dimensional hydrodynamic model and the hydrological unit hydrograph theory. Unit hydrographs are derived using the FLOW-R2D model which is based on the full form of two-dimensional Shallow Water Equations, solved by a modified McCormack numerical scheme. The method is tested at a small catchment in a suburb of Athens-Greece for a storm event which occurred in February 2013. The catchment is divided into three friction zones and unit hydrographs of 15 and 30 min are produced. The infiltration process is simulated by the empirical Kostiakov equation and the Green-Ampt model. The results from the implementation of the proposed hybrid method are compared with recorded data at the hydrometric station at the outlet of the catchment and the results derived from the fully hydrodynamic model FLOW-R2D. It is concluded that for the case studied, the proposed hybrid method produces results close to those of the fully hydrodynamic simulation at substantially shorter computational time. This finding, if further verified in a variety of case studies, can be useful in devising effective hybrid tools for the two-dimensional flood simulations, which are lead to accurate and considerably faster results than those achieved by the fully hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract = {The damage caused by floods is increasing worldwide, and if floods can be predicted, the economic and human losses from floods can be reduced. A key parameter of flooding is water level data, and this paper proposes a water level prediction model using long short-term memory (LSTM) and a gated recurrent unit (GRU). As variables used as input data, meteorological data, including upstream and downstream water level, temperature, humidity, and precipitation, were used. The best results were obtained when the LSTM–GRU-based model and the Automated Synoptic Observing System (ASOS) meteorological data were included in the input data when experiments were performed with various model structures and different input data formats. As a result of the experiment, the mean squared error (MSE) value was 3.92, the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) value was 0.942, and the mean absolute error (MAE) value was 2.22, the highest result in all cases. In addition, the test data included the historical maximum water level of 3552.38 cm in the study area, and the maximum water level error was also recorded as 55.49, the lowest result. Through this paper, it was possible to confirm the performance difference according to the composition of the input data and the time series prediction model. In a future study, we plan to implement a flood risk management system that can use the predicted water level to determine the risk of flooding, and evacuate in advance.},

In this formalism, a classification or regression decision tree is used as a predictive model to draw conclusions about a set of observations. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees. More generally, the concept of regression tree can be extended to any kind of object equipped with pairwise dissimilarities such as categorical sequences. Decision trees are among the most popular machine learning algorithms given their intelligibility and simplicity. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. In data mining, a decision tree describes data (but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making).},

  abstract = {Several studies have shown that hydrological models do not perform well when applied to periods with climate conditions that differ from those during model calibration. This has important implications for the application of these models in climate change impact studies. The causes of the low transferability to changed climate conditions have, however, only been investigated in a few studies. Here we revisit a study in Austria that demonstrated the inability of a conceptual semi-distributed HBV-type model to simulate the observed discharge response to increases in precipitation and air temperature. The aim of the paper is to shed light on the reasons for these model problems. We set up hypotheses for the possible causes of the mismatch between the observed and simulated changes in discharge and evaluate these using simulations with modifications of the model. In the baseline model, trends of simulated and observed discharge over 1978–2013 differ, on average over all 156 catchments, by 95±50\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr−1 per 35 years. Accounting for variations in vegetation dynamics, as derived from a satellite-based vegetation index, in the calculation of reference evaporation explains 36±9\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr−1 per 35 years of the differences between the trends in simulated and observed discharge. Inhomogeneities in the precipitation data, caused by a variable number of stations, explain 39±26\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr−1 per 35 years of this difference. Extending the calibration period from 5 to 25 years, including annually aggregated discharge data or snow cover data in the objective function, or estimating evaporation with the Penman–Monteith instead of the Blaney–Criddle approach has little influence on the simulated discharge trends (5\&thinsp;mm\&thinsp;yr−1 per 35 years or less). The precipitation data problem highlights the importance of using precipitation data based on a stationary input station network when studying hydrologic changes. The model structure problem with respect to vegetation dynamics is likely relevant for a wide spectrum of regions in a transient climate and has important implications for climate change impact studies.},

  abstract = {Rainfall–runoff modelling is one of the key challenges in the field of hydrology. Various approaches exist, ranging from physically based over conceptual to fully data-driven models. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a special type of recurrent neural network. The advantage of the LSTM is its ability to learn long-term dependencies between the provided input and output of the network, which are essential for modelling storage effects in e.g. catchments with snow influence. We use 241 catchments of the freely available CAMELS data set to test our approach and also compare the results to the well-known Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA) coupled with the Snow-17 snow routine. We also show the potential of the LSTM as a regional hydrological model in which one model predicts the discharge for a variety of catchments. In our last experiment, we show the possibility to transfer process understanding, learned at regional scale, to individual catchments and thereby increasing model performance when compared to a LSTM trained only on the data of single catchments. Using this approach, we were able to achieve better model performance as the SAC-SMA\&thinsp;+\&thinsp;Snow-17, which underlines the potential of the LSTM for hydrological modelling applications.},

  abstract = {IMproving PRedictions and management of hydrological EXtremes (IMPREX) was a European Union Horizon 2020 project that ran from September 2015 to September 2019. IMPREX aimed to improve society’s ability to anticipate and respond to future extreme hydrological events in Europe across a variety of uses in the water-related sectors (flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, agriculture, navigation, hydropower and water supply utilities). Through the engagement with stakeholders and continuous feedback between model outputs and water applications, progress was achieved in better understanding the way hydrological predictions can be useful to (and operationally incorporated into) problem-solving in the water sector. The work and discussions carried out during the project nurtured further reflections toward a common vision for hydrological prediction. In this article, we summarized the main findings of the IMPREX project within a broader overview of hydrological prediction, providing a vision for improving such predictions. In so doing, we first presented a synopsis of hydrological and weather forecasting, with a focus on medium-range to seasonal scales of prediction for increased preparedness. Second, the lessons learned from IMPREX were discussed. The key findings were the gaps highlighted in the global observing system of the hydrological cycle, the degree of accuracy of hydrological models and the techniques of post-processing to correct biases, the origin of seasonal hydrological skill in Europe and user requirements of hydrometeorological forecasts to ensure their appropriate use in decision-making models and practices. Last, a vision for how to improve these forecast systems/products in the future was expounded, including advancing numerical weather and hydrological models, improved earth monitoring and more frequent interaction between forecasters and users to tailor the forecasts to applications. We conclude that if these improvements can be implemented in the coming years, earth system and hydrological modelling will become more skillful, thus leading to socioeconomic benefits for the citizens of Europe and beyond.},

  abstract = {For a number of years since its introduction to hydrology, recurrent neural networks like long short-term memory (LSTM) have proven remarkably difficult to surpass in terms of daily hydrograph metrics on known, comparable benchmarks. Outside of hydrology, Transformers have now become the model of choice for sequential prediction tasks, making it a curious architecture to investigate. Here, we first show that a vanilla Transformer architecture is not competitive against LSTM on the widely benchmarked CAMELS dataset, and lagged especially for the high-flow metrics due to short-term processes. However, a recurrence-free variant of Transformer can obtain mixed comparisons with LSTM, producing the same Kling-Gupta efficiency coefficient (KGE), along with other metrics. The lack of advantages for the Transformer is linked to the Markovian nature of the hydrologic prediction problem. Similar to LSTM, the Transformer can also merge multiple forcing dataset to improve model performance. While the Transformer results are not higher than current state-of-the-art, we still learned some valuable lessons: (1) the vanilla Transformer architecture is not suitable for hydrologic modeling; (2) the proposed recurrence-free modification can improve Transformer performance so future work can continue to test more of such modifications; and (3) the prediction limits on the dataset should be close to the current state-of-the-art model. As a non-recurrent model, the Transformer may bear scale advantages for learning from bigger datasets and storing knowledge. This work serves as a reference point for future modifications of the model.},

In this paper, utilizing these data to construct deep neural network models for water level prediction is focused. To achieve higher accuracy, both the factors of time and locations of data collection sensors are considered to perform prediction. And the network structures of gated recurrent unit (GRU) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are combined to build a CNN-GRU model in which the GRU part learns the changing trend of water level, and the CNN part learns the spatial correlation among water level data observed from adjacent water stations. The CNN-GRU model that using data from multiple locations to predict the water level of the middle location has higher accuracy than the model only based on GRU and other state-of-the-art methods including autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA), wavelet-based artificial neural network (WANN) and long-short term memory model (LSTM), because of its ability to decrease the affections of abnormal value and data randomness of a single water station to some extent. The results are verified on an experiment dataset that including 30-year observed data of water level at several collection stations in the Yangtze River. For forecasting the 8-o'clock water levels of future 5 days, accuracy of the CNN-GRU model is better than that of ARIMA, WANN and LSTM models with three evaluation factors including Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), average relative error (MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE).},

  abstract = {In the hydrological sciences, the outstanding challenge of regional modeling requires to capture common and event-specific hydrologic behaviors driven by rainfall spatial variability and catchment physiography during floods. The overall objective of this study is to develop robust understanding and predictive capability of how rainfall spatial variability influences flood peak discharge relative to basin physiography. A machine-learning approach is used on a high-resolution dataset of rainfall and flooding events spanning 10 years, with rainfall events and basins of widely varying characteristics selected across the continental United States. It overcomes major limitations in prior studies that were based on limited observations or hydrological model simulations. This study explores first-order dependencies in the relationships between peak discharge, rainfall variability, and basin physiography, and it sheds light on these complex interactions using a multidimensional statistical modeling approach. Among different machine-learning techniques, XGBoost is used to determine the significant physiographical and rainfall characteristics that influence peak discharge through variable importance analysis. A parsimonious model with low bias and variance is created that can be deployed in the future for flash flood forecasting. The results confirm that, although the spatial organization of rainfall within a basin has a major influence on basin response, basin physiography is the primary driver of peak discharge. These findings have unprecedented spatial and temporal representativeness in terms of flood characterization across basins. An improved understanding of subbasin scale rainfall spatial variability will aid in robust flash flood characterization as well as with identifying basins that could most benefit from distributed hydrologic modeling.},

Recent efforts in hydrology have aimed at predicting water flow, floods, and quality, yet most methodologies overlook the influence of adjacent areas and lack advanced visualization for water level assessment. Our contribution is two-fold: firstly, we introduce a graph neural network model (LocalFLoodNet) equipped with a graph learning module to capture the interconnections of water systems and the connectivity between stations to predict future water levels. Secondly, we develop a simulation prototype offering visual insights for decision-making in disaster prevention and policy-making. This prototype visualizes predicted water levels and facilitates data analysis using decades of historical information. Focusing on the Greater Montreal Area (GMA), particularly Terrebonne, Quebec, Canada, we apply LocalFLoodNet and prototype to demonstrate a comprehensive method for assessing flood impacts. By utilizing a digital twin of Terrebonne, our simulation tool allows users to interactively modify the landscape and simulate various flood scenarios, thereby providing valuable insights into preventive strategies. This research aims to enhance water level prediction and evaluation of preventive measures, setting a benchmark for similar applications across different geographic areas.},

  abstract = {The machine learning algorithm ‘random forest’ has been applied in many areas of water resources research including discharge simulation. Due to low setup and operation cost, random forest could represent an alternative approach to physical and conceptual hydrological models for large-scale hazard assessment in multiple catchments. Yet, the applicability of random forest to flood discharge simulation requires further exploration, especially with respect to heterogeneous catchments and daily temporal resolution. In this study, we simulate flood event and peak discharge on a daily time scale for 95 study basins in Canada and the USA. We comparatively evaluate the predictive performance of random forest against the conceptual hydrological modeling package ‘hydromad’ and assess the influence of catchment characteristics on model performance. Our analysis showed that random forest is competitive to hydromad in the simulation of low and medium flood magnitudes. However, both models exhibit inaccuracies for higher flood events. Relating catchment characteristics to model skill, we found that primarily climatic conditions and elevation affect the flood simulation capability. We conclude that random forest provides a low-cost and, yet, competitive alternative to conventional rainfall-runoff models in large-scale flood discharge simulation. Nevertheless, without further model advancements, the presented models only provide robust discharge predictions for small and medium magnitude floods in low altitude catchments with warm temperate climate.},
